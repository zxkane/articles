# So, Who Am I?

----
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a proud dad of three awesome boys who keep me on my toes (and occasionally drive me crazy ðŸ˜…). Currently calling Beijing my home, where I juggle parenting with my tech adventures.

Speaking of tech - I'm one of those *nix nerds who gets excited about terminal commands and clean code. By day, I wear multiple hats as a full-stack software engineer, but I also geek out over DevOps and all things cloud native especially Serverless technologies. Think of me as a digital Swiss Army knife - I love tinkering with different technologies and making things work seamlessly together!

When I'm not chasing my kids around or diving deep into code, you might find me obsessing over the latest tech trends or trying to automate yet another part of my life (because who doesn't love a good automation script, right? ðŸ¤–).

Want to know more about my adventures in tech and parenting? Feel free to stalk me (professionally, of course!) through the social links above. I promise my feed is a fun mix of code snippets, tech thoughts, and occasional dad jokes! ðŸ˜‰
