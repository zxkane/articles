2.  **Quick Research**: A powerful agent that conducts research across enterprise data and external sources to deliver contextual, actionable insights in minutes. It breaks down complex questions, gathers information, and validates findings with citations.
3.  **Quick Sight**: An AI-powered BI solution that transforms data into insights through natural language queries and interactive visualizations. It enables users to build dashboards, perform what-if analysis, and respond with one-click actions.
4.  **Quick Flows**: A tool for automating repetitive tasks using natural language. It fetches information, takes action in business applications, generates content, and handles process-specific requirements.
5.  **Quick Automate**: A solution for enterprise-scale process automation that transforms complex business processes into multi-agent workflows, complete with advanced orchestration, governance, and observability.

The platform serves three user personas:

-   **Readers**: Access dashboards, run automations, and consume insights.
-   **Authors**: Build datasets, create agents, and design workflows.
-   **Administrators**: Manage permissions, monitor costs, and maintain data sources.

What truly sets Quick Suite apart is its conversational AI interface. Instead of wrestling with complex query languages, you can ask questions and get intelligent, context-aware responses backed by your organization's data.

## Four Powerful Benefits of Amazon Quick Suite

### 1. Custom Chat Agents with Your Data

Create **AI agents** that understand your business domain and answer questions using your organization's private data—no coding required.

**Key Features**:
-   Upload company documentation, policies, and procedures as agent knowledge.
-   Connect to multiple data sources: databases (RDS, PostgreSQL), SaaS apps (Salesforce, Jira), data warehouses (Redshift), and spreadsheets.
-   Ask questions in plain English and receive answers with auto-generated visualizations.
-   Export results as reports, dashboards, or data files.

**Example in Action**:
```plaintext
You: "Show me our top 10 products by revenue this quarter
     compared to last quarter, broken down by region."

Agent: [Queries database, performs analysis, generates comparative charts]

You: "Why did the Northeast region decline?"

Agent: [Analyzes details, identifies patterns, visualizes root causes]
```

The agent maintains conversational context, understands your business logic, and automatically chooses the right visualizations, turning complex data analysis into a natural dialogue.

## 5 Best Practices for Production-Ready BI Agents

These five practices are critical for building reliable and accurate data analysis agents.

### Practice 1: Preview Every Transformation Step

Amazon Quick Suite's visual data preparation interface lets you transform data without SQL, but the key to success is **previewing after every single change**. One bad transformation can corrupt everything downstream.

**The Visual Workflow**:
Amazon Quick Suite visualizes your transformations as a sequential pipeline, where each step is editable.

    P5 --> F[Join Tables] --> P6{Preview}
    P6 --> G[Publish Dataset]

    style P6 fill:#60a5fa,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style G fill:#10b981,stroke:#059669,color:#fff
```

**Example**:
```plaintext
Step 1: Import sales_data.csv → Preview shows 10,000 rows. ✓
Step 2: Filter out test transactions → Preview shows 9,847 rows. ✓
Step 3: Cast "sale_date" from String to Date → Preview shows proper dates. ✓
Step 4: Cast "amount" from String to Decimal → Preview shows 12 nulls. ⚠️
        → Investigation: Found "$1,234.56" format needs cleaning.
        → Add step: Remove "$" and "," before casting.
        → Preview again: 0 nulls. ✓
```
This iterative validation is crucial for building reliable datasets.

### Practice 2: Handle DateTime Conversion Carefully

When datetime strings don't match supported formats, Amazon Quick Suite doesn't fail—it silently converts them to **null**. This can lead to incomplete results that are difficult to detect.

**The Problem**:
```plaintext
Your data: "2025.10.29" (dot separator - not supported)
After cast to Date: NULL
Import status: ✓ Success (no error!)
Query result: Missing dates, inaccurate metrics.
```

**Supported Formats** ([AWS docs][date-formats]):
-   **ISO 8601 (Recommended)**: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`
-   **Common US Formats**: `MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss` and `MM-dd-yyyy`

**⚠️ Important**: Always use a 4-digit year (`yyyy`). Two-digit years (`yy`) are not supported and will result in nulls.

**Prevention**: Always preview your data after a datetime conversion and check for unexpected nulls.

### Practice 3: Sanitize Monetary Values

Financial data is often formatted with currency symbols and commas (`"$1,234.56"`), which Amazon Quick Suite interprets as strings. Attempts to perform calculations on these fields will fail or produce incorrect results.

**The Solution**:
Clean the data either before import or during dataset preparation in Amazon Quick Suite.

1.  **Create a calculated field** to remove symbols and commas:
    ```
    parseDecimal(replace(replace(revenue, "$", ""), ",", ""))
    ```
2.  **Preview the conversion** to ensure all values are now numeric.
3.  **Set the field role** to "Measure" (see Practice 4).
4.  **Hide the original string field** to avoid confusion.

For high-precision financial calculations, use the `Decimal-fixed` data type to prevent floating-point errors.

### Practice 4: Set Field Roles Explicitly (Measure vs. Dimension)

Amazon Quick Suite assigns every field a role: **Measure** (for aggregation) or **Dimension** (for grouping). The auto-detection can be wrong, leading to broken analytics.

-   **Measure**: A field you can aggregate (e.g., SUM, AVG). Examples: `revenue`, `quantity`.
-   **Dimension**: A field you use to group or filter. Examples: `product_category`, `region`, `customer_id`.

**Common Mistake**: A numeric `customer_id` might be auto-detected as a Measure, leading to meaningless calculations like `AVG(customer_id)`.

**Best Practice**: Manually set roles for all fields.
-   Numeric IDs (`customer_id`, `zip_code`) should be **Dimensions**.
-   Calculated metrics (`profit`, `conversion_rate`) should be **Measures**.

### Practice 5: Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Row-Level Security (RLS)** is essential for controlling data access in multi-user environments. It restricts which rows users can see in a dataset. (RLS is an Amazon QuickSight Enterprise Edition feature).

**How It Works**:
RLS uses a separate **rules dataset** to define permissions.

```plaintext
Main Dataset (sales_data):        Rules Dataset (sales_rls_rules):
order_id, region, amount          UserName, region
O-1001, East, $5000               alice@company.com, East
O-1002, West, $8000               bob@company.com, West
O-1003, East, $3000               alice@company.com, East

When alice queries → She only sees "East" region rows.
When bob queries → He only sees "West" region rows.
```

**Critical Limitation**: RLS rules only work with **text fields**. To filter by numbers or dates, you must first cast those fields to strings in your rules dataset.

**Implementation Steps**:
1.  **Create a Rules Dataset**: A CSV or database table with `UserName` and the fields to restrict.
2.  **Upload the Rules**: Create a new dataset in Amazon Quick Suite and mark it as containing RLS rules.
3.  **Apply to Main Dataset**: In your main dataset's permissions, apply the rules dataset.

## Quick Start: Build Your First AI Agent in 7 Steps

Let's build a **Customer Support Analytics Agent**.

**Goal**: Analyze support tickets to identify trends, measure team performance, and predict resolution times.

1.  **Prepare Your Data**: Start with a `support_tickets.csv` file containing ticket details.
2.  **Create & Transform Dataset**: In Amazon Quick Suite, create a new dataset and apply transformations.
    -   **Fix Dates**: Use `parseDate` to convert date strings to the correct format.
    -   **Clean Money**: Use `parseDecimal` and `replace` to clean monetary values.
    -   **Calculate Metrics**: Create new fields like `resolution_hours` using `dateDiff`.
    -   **Set Roles**: Define `agent_id` as a Dimension and `resolution_hours` as a Measure.
3.  **Create a Topic**: Make your dataset conversational by linking it to a new Topic and adding custom instructions like `"SLA is 24 hours"`.
4.  **Create a Space**: Bundle your Topic and related documentation into a Space for your support team.
5.  **Create the Chat Agent**: Create an agent, link it to your Space, and give it a persona, such as `"You are a support analytics assistant."`
6.  **Test with Real Questions**: Validate the agent with progressively complex queries, from simple counts to comparative analyses.
7.  **Share with Your Team**: Deploy the agent, space, and topic for your organization to use.
