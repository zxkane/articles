**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Explanation**: For human developers, this task is relatively straightforward. It involves copying and pasting the existing theme code multiple times, then making necessary adjustments to the color and style properties. The process is simple and does not require advanced programming skills, as it mainly focuses on duplicating and modifying existing code snippets to create a new theme.

| Windsurf | ❌ Failed | - | No support for external documentation fetching. Generated code had multiple compilation errors in both Amplify Gen2 resources and Lambda functions. |

### Task 3: Next.js 15 and React 19 Migration

**Task Detail**: Upgrade the web application from Next.js 14.x to Next.js 15.x, which includes upgrading to React from 18.x to 19.x accordingly. There is an implicit requirement to upgrade other UI dependencies to support React 19.x, including Amplify UI React, MUI 5.x, and react-draggable.  
**Difficulty**: Hard  
**Explanation**: This task requires exploring the implicit dependencies between UI components and React 19. The AI developer needs to understand these dependencies through internet searches and codebase analysis. Another challenge is handling compatibility issues between Next.js 15, React 19, and existing code usage, updating routing patterns, and adapting to new Next.js or React APIs.

**Note**: For this challenging migration test case, we only evaluated tools/IDEs that demonstrated strong performance in the previous test cases. This focused approach allowed us to better assess the capabilities of the most promising solutions when handling complex migration tasks.

| Tool | Result | Cost | Detailed Notes |
|------|---------|------|---------------|
| Cursor (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) | ✅ Success | ~25 fast requests in Pro subscription | Successfully upgraded core Next.js and React versions but required significant human assistance for dependency resolution. Struggled with conflicts between React 19 and UI libraries (amplify-ui-react, mui 5.x, react-draggable). Successfully implemented code changes after being provided with specific resolution steps. Successfully resolved the errors after upgrading to newer React and Next.js with providing the online migration guidelines. |
| Cline (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) | ✅ Success | $25+ | Successfully completed version upgrades for Next.js, React, MUI, and Amplify UI React with detailed human guidance. Generated correct code to mitigate errors in Next.js based on migration guides and external documentation (like GitHub issues). However, showed inconsistent performance when handling migration-related errors - a same task was resolved quickly for under $1, while another attempt required multiple requests costing over $12. |
| Cline (Deepseek V3) | ⚠️ Partial | $0.055/¥0.4 | Successfully upgraded Next.js, React, MUI, and Amplify UI React versions with human guidance. Generated correct fixes for some migration errors in newer Next.js and React versions, but couldn't resolve all issues. The Deepseek API demonstrated stability issues, often encountering unexpected errors during processing. |
